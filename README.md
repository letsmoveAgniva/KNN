# KNN
•  Implemented K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search algorithm for efficient nearest neighbor retrieval in very large dataset(s) in C++

•  Implemented KD (K-Dimensional) &  RP (Random Projection) Tree reducing the search time 100x compared to the naive approach

•  Utilized Object-Oriented Design with inheritance from a TreeIndex base class and created an abstract DataVector for data storage

•  Created a console-based interface for users to construct KD Trees and RP Trees and perform KNN searches on datasets
